## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Whose woods these are I think I know.     
His house is in the village though;     
He will not see me stopping here     
To watch his woods fill up with snow.     

My little horse must think it queer     

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,    
      Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.   
      The billows smooth and bright —    
And this was odd, because it was.   
      The middle of the night.    
 
The moon was shining sulkily,    
      Because she thought the sun.   
Had got no business to be there.   
      After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
      "To come and spoil the fun."    

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the arena, where passions ignite,    
Athletes with valor, in the spotlight.    
With muscles and heart, they take their stand,    
In the world of sports, where dreams expand.    

On the pitch, in the sun's warm embrace,    
Soccer players dazzle, with skill and grace.    
They chase the ball, with each thrilling pass,    
In this beautiful game, where legends amass.    

The basketball court, a stage for the tall,    
Dribbling and shooting, they give it their all.    
From slam dunks to threes, the crowd's on its feet,    
In this fast-paced sport, where victory's sweet.    

In the ring, boxers battle their might,    
With punches and jabs, they fight for the light.    
Their sweat and their blood, the price they pay,    
In the noble art of boxing, night turns to day.    

On the track, sprinters flash like a blaze,    
Running their race, in a thunderous craze.    
They break records and barriers, set their sights high,    
In the world of athletics, where dreams touch the sky.    

From swimming to skiing, from cricket to golf,    
In sports of all kinds, we find the soul's waltz.    
For in competition, we test our own grace,    
In the world of sports, where champions embrace.    

So let's celebrate this world of play,    
Where athletes inspire, in their own unique way.    
In victories and defeats, in moments sublime,    
Sports unite us all, across space and time.
